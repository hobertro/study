How does monitoring empower you?; It allows you to catch complications before they develop into problems, and helps you preserve high availability and deliver high quality of service.
What does monitoring mean in the context of web applications?; Becoming aware of the state of the system
What is monitoring?; The process of maintaining surveillance over the existence and magnitude of state change and data flow in a system.
What are the aims of monitoring?; Monitoring aims to identify faults and assist in their subsequent elimination
What are the techniques used in monitoring?; Real-time processing, statistics, and data analysis
What is alerting?; The capability of a monitoring system to detect and notify the operators about meaningful events that denote a grave change of state.
Why is it important to establish performance levels? (3); It finds application in capacity planning, leads to data formulation of data-backed SLAs, and be a starting point for in-depth performance analysis.
What is time series data?; Chronologically ordered lists of data points
What is the main purpose of monitoring?; Gain near real-time insight into the current state of the system, in the context of its recent performance.
What should compete monitoring cover? (3); Resource availability, software performance, and user behavior.
What is a metric?; A data structure optimized for storage and retrieval of numeric inputs
What are the important properties that describe data input? (2); The origin of the measurement and its attributes such as units and time
What is a monitoring system?; A monitoring system is a set of software components that performs measurements and collects, stores, and interprets the monitored data
What is the main purpose of monitoring?; To gain near real-time insight into the current state of the system, in the context of its recent performance.
The basic currency in the world of information systems is what?; Unit of capacity
The cost of any user activity can be expressed in what ?; The resources it uses
What is an example of a typical computation action in a web service environment?; A request. Every request takes resources: at a minimum it consumes memory and CPU cycles, but frequently it also reads and writes some data to other devices such as disk drives, introducing futher I/O cost
The depletion of any resource required to serve a request leads to what?; Performance bottleneck
Why is meeting load with additional capacity now always desireable?; Because of Denial fo Service attacks, where an attacker's object is to shut down the service by driving the saturation of the scarcest resource it can manipulate.
The solution stack commonly consists of what three parts?; The operating system, middleware, and an application on running on top.
