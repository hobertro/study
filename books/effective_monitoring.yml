- front: "Why is it important to establish performance levels? (3)"
  back: "It finds application in capacity planning, leads to data formulation of data-backed SLAs, and be a starting point for in-depth performance analysis."

- front: "What is an example of a typical computation action in a web service environment?"
  back: "A request. Every request takes resources: at a minimum it consumes memory and CPU cycles, but frequently it also reads and writes some data to other devices such as disk drives, introducing futher I/O cost"
  tags: []
- front: "The depletion of any resource required to serve a request leads to what?"
  back: "Performance bottleneck"
  tags: []
- front: "Why is meeting load with additional capacity now always desireable?"
  back: "Because of Denial fo Service attacks, where an attacker's object is to shut down the service by driving the saturation of the scarcest resource it can manipulate."

- front: "The solution stack commonly consists of what three parts?"
  back: "The operating system, middleware, and an application on running on top."
